# Ach as a Service

Need to receive payments or send money to multiple people with different
providers, this service will make all the heavylift, so everything that needs
to be done is to make POST with all the transactions, everything else will be
handled here.

Everyday we will check for returns, will process those returns and send a
digest with the interesting stuff so you can action downstream.

## Roadmap

We may add a dashboard for buisness people to have fun.
